Export your Apple Watch's health data from the Health app on your iPhone. You can do this by going to the Health app, clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner, and then clicking on "Export All Health Data". 

This will create a zip file with all of your health data. Unzip this file and place the contents in the `data` directory. 

Export your Strong App data by going to the Strong app, clicking on **Profile** ‚á® **Settings** ‚á® **Export Strong Data**.

This will create a `.csv` file with all of your Strong data. Place the contents in the `data` directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/nathanjones4323/healthy-py.git
```

Navigate to the app's directory
```
cd healthy-py
```

Create a `data` directory in the root of the app
```
mkdir data
```

Add your Apple Watch's health data and Strong App exports to the `data` directory.


Start the container and seed the database with your health data

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Stop the container

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

## TODO <a name = "todo"></a>

* `./metabase/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/create_questions.py` needs to run as a DB init script.
* When initializing Metabase with the automated reports, create the "Strong" `collection` in metabase before the `report_card`
* Data types are broken when you import the `report_card` data into Metabase. Need to fix this.
* Must disable the Friendly display names setting in Metabase admin for the `report_card` data to import correctly. Manual for now
* Find a dynamic way to set the values for 
  * graph.x_axis.title_text
  * graph.y_axis.title_text
  * graph.dimensions
  * graph.metrics
