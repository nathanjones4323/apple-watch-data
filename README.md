## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a full stack BI application powered by Python, Docker, and Metabase. It is designed to be a one stop shop for analyzing all of your health data from all of your favorite sources:

### Supported Data Sources

- ⌚ [Apple Health Data](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/)
- 🏋️ [Strong App](https://www.strong.app/)

### Roadmap Data Sources

There are many more data sources that I would like to add to this app. If you have any suggestions, please open an issue or a pull request!

## 🔒 Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

Docker ([Docker Desktop comes with Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Getting the data

Export your Apple Watch's health data from the Health app on your iPhone. 

Open the Health app:
Click **Profile** (profile picture right corner) ⇨ **Export All Health Data**. This will create a zip file with all of your health data. Unzip this file.

Export your Strong App data by going to the Strong app, clicking on **Profile** ⇨ **Settings** ⇨ **Export Strong Data**. This will create a `.csv` file with all of your Strong data. 

Get these files onto the computer that you are running the app on (I usually AirDrop them to my Mac).

### Adding the data to the appropriate directories

Clone the repoisitory
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanjones4323/healthy-py.git
```

Navigate to the app's directory
```
cd healthy-py
```

Create a `data` directory in the root of the app
```
mkdir data
```

Add your Apple Watch's health data (the entire folder) and Strong App exports to the `data` directory.

At this point your `data` directory should look like this:

```
data
├── apple_health_export
│   ├── electrocardiograms
│   │   ├── ecg_2023-09-05.csv
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── ecg_2023-09-06.csv
│   ├── export.xml
│   ├── export_cda.xml
│   └── workout-routes
│       ├── route_2023-09-05_8.40pm.gpx
│       ├── ...
│       └── route_2023-09-08_7.20pm.gpx
└── strong_export
    └── strong.csv
```

### Creating and populating the .env files

Create an `.env` file in each of these directories:

```zsh
healthy-py/db
healthy-py/metabase
healthy-py/metabase/backend
```

By running the following commands inside of the root directory:

```zsh
mkdir db && touch db/.env
mkdir metabase && touch metabase/.env
mkdir metabase/backend && touch metabase/backend/.env
```

Fill in the following values in the `.env` files:

`healthy-py/db/.env` - These will be the values you input inside of the Metabase UI when you create an admin user and connect to the database.

```zsh
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
POSTGRES_PORT=
```

`healthy-py/metabase/.env` - These values will be automaticaly identified and used by Metabase when you run the container to set up the Metabase instance

```zsh
MB_DB_TYPE=
MB_DB_DBNAME=
MB_DB_PORT=5432
MB_DB_USER=
MB_DB_PASS=
MB_DB_HOST=metabase-backend
# Admin User Credentials
MB_ADMIN_EMAIL=
MB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
```

`healthy-py/metabase/backend/.env` - These values will be automaticaly identified and used by Metabase when you run the container to initialize a user for the Metabase backend

```zsh
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
```

## 🏃 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Navigate to the app's directory
```
cd healthy-py
```

Start the container and seed the database with your health data

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

If this is your first time running the app, you'll have to wait ~30 seconds for Metabase to start before accessing http://localhost:3000/.

If the page is not loading, wait a few more seconds and refresh. Once you see the Metabase set up page, you can proceed to set up your admin user and connect to the database.

> :warning: You must use values from the `metabase/.env` file and `db/.env` file when setting up the admin user and connecting to the database.

You should use the following values when setting up the admin user:

```
# Admin User Credentials
MB_ADMIN_EMAIL
MB_ADMIN_PASSWORD

# Database Credentials
POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_DB
POSTGRES_PORT
```

After you have set up the admin user and connected to the database, you will see that all of the automatic analysis (Metabase collections, questions, and dashboards) has been added. (This process takes ~5 minutes, you can check the status of the process by inspecting the logs of the `init-metabase-questions` container)

Stop the container

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

> :warning: If you need to rebuild and run the container run this command

```
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d && docker image prune -f
```

## 📓 TODO <a name = "todo"></a>

*TODOs are in order of priority*

* Need to update this step from `questions.py`
```python
# Add the field filters to the payload (template-tags)
  my_custom_json = add_field_filters(

To handle the `[[ and reps >= {{min_reps}} ]]` min max filters. Right now it is only set up for field filters

  * Research and brainstorm more questions

* Create a dashboard with all of the questions ==> [Link to API documentation to automate adding questions to dashboards](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/api/dashboard#put-apidashboardid)

* For the API to work, the Metabase admin must be logged in. This is not ideal. Need to find a way to authenticate the API calls without doing setup through the GUI.
* Find a dynamic way to set the values for
