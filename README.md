## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Getting the data

Export your Apple Watch's health data from the Health app on your iPhone. You can do this by going to the Health app, clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner, and then clicking on "Export All Health Data". 

This will create a zip file with all of your health data. Unzip this file and place the contents in the `data` directory. 

Export your Strong App data by going to the Strong app, clicking on **Profile** ‚á® **Settings** ‚á® **Export Strong Data**.

This will create a `.csv` file with all of your Strong data. Place the contents in the `data` directory.

### Adding the data to the appropriate directories

Clone the repoisitory
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanjones4323/healthy-py.git
```

Navigate to the app's directory
```
cd healthy-py
```

Create a `data` directory in the root of the app
```
mkdir data
```

Add your Apple Watch's health data (the entire folder) and Strong App exports to the `data` directory.

### Creating and populating the .env files

Create an `.env` file in each of these directories:

```zsh
healthy-py/db
healthy-py/metabase
healthy-py/metabase/backend
```

```zsh
touch healthy-py/db/.env
touch healthy-py/metabase/.env
touch healthy-py/metabase/backend/.env
```

Fill in the following values in the `.env` files:

`healthy-py/db/.env` - These will be the values you input inside of the Metabase UI when you create an admin user and connect to the database.

```zsh
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
POSTGRES_PORT=
```

`healthy-py/metabase/.env` - These values will be automaticaly identified and used by Metabase when you run the container to set up the Metabase instance

```zsh
MB_DB_TYPE=
MB_DB_DBNAME=
MB_DB_PORT=5432
MB_DB_USER=
MB_DB_PASS=
MB_DB_HOST=metabase-backend
# Admin User Credentials
MB_ADMIN_EMAIL=
MB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
```

`healthy-py/metabase/backend/.env` - These values will be automaticaly identified and used by Metabase when you run the container to initialize a user for the Metabase backend

```zsh
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
```

## üèÉ Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Navigate to the app's directory
```
cd healthy-py
```

Start the container and seed the database with your health data

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Stop the container

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

> :warning: If you need to rebuild and run the container run this command
```
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d && docker image prune -f
```

  * Research and brainstorm more questions

* Create a dashboard with all of the questions
* Make the start of the `init-metabase-questions` container wait using `docker-compose.yml` instead of using `time.sleep` with the `auth` function inside of `metabase-api/init/auth.py`
* For the API to work, the Metabase admin must be logged in. This is not ideal. Need to find a way to authenticate the API calls without doing setup through the GUI.
* Find a dynamic way to set the values for
  * graph.x_axis.title_text
  * graph.y_axis.title_text
  * graph.dimensions
  * graph.metrics
